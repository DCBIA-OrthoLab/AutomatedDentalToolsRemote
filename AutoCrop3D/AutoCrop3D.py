"""
Crop CBCT volumes to a region of interest drawn in Slicer (AutoCrop3D).

Thin GUI over the remote `AutoCrop3D` tool. The crop itself is arithmetic on an
image grid -- no weights, no GPU, no network -- but it runs on the server like
every other tool, so a cohort of 512x512x365 volumes is never resampled in
Slicer's own interpreter.

It replaces a local module that computed here; `Crop_Volumes_CLI/` and the
hand-written `Crop_Volumes_UI/` went with it. The panel is generated from the
server's `GET /tools` entry.
