"""
Teeth and jaw structures on dental CT and CBCT (Batch_Dental_Seg).

Thin GUI over the remote `Batch_Dental_Seg` tool. The nnU-Net inference runs on
the server, so torch is never installed into Slicer's interpreter and no weight
bundle is downloaded to this machine.

What the remote tool deliberately does not carry over is most of what the local
module was: a queue table, a RAM watchdog, killing nnUNet processes a crashed
scan left behind, a cool-down between scans, restoring the queue from disk. All
of that existed because inference ran inside Slicer on a clinician's laptop and
had to survive being out of memory. Here the queue is a folder argument and the
memory is the server's, and `BATCHDENTALSEGLib/` has gone with the local
inference it existed to drive.
