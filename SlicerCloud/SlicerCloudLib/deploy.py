"""Driving a local tool-server deployment: clone, docker, start, update, data.

Same dependency rule as `client.py` (see ARCHITECTURE.md): **this module
imports neither `slicer` nor `qt`**, so it runs — and is unit-tested — in plain
CI with no Slicer interpreter. Everything it does is `subprocess` plus the
standard library.

It is deliberately thin. The real logic lives in the server repository's
`scripts/server_ctl.py`, which this class clones and then calls: the panel and
the terminal therefore do exactly the same thing, and a fix to the deployment
logic ships with the server rather than needing a new extension release. The
one thing that cannot be delegated is the bootstrap — you cannot run a script
out of a clone that does not exist yet — so `probe_host()` and `clone()` are
implemented here and nothing else is.

`server_ctl.py --json` prints one JSON object on stdout and narrates on
stderr, which is what lets `run_ctl` stream a live log into the GUI *and*
return a parsed result from the same call.
