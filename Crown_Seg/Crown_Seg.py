"""
Per-tooth labelling of intraoral surface scans (Crown_Seg).

Thin GUI over the remote `Crown_Seg` tool. The segmentation runs on the server,
so `shapeaxi` and its torch stack are never installed into Slicer's interpreter
and no checkpoint is downloaded to this machine -- which is the whole reason the
old path shelled out to a `dentalmodelseg` binary in Slicer's own bin directory.

Its own module rather than a step inside ALI: the labelled array it writes is the
precondition for ALI's IOS landmarks and for the IOS modes of ASO, AREG and
FlexReg, so four chains need it and none of them owns it.
