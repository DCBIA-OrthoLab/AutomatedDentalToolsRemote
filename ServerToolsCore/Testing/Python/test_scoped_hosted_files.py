"""An argument that draws from one subfolder, not from the tool's whole catalogue.

A tool can serve several modalities -- AREG registers CBCT volumes, intraoral
surfaces, and one onto the other -- and the hosted-file list is published per
TOOL. Flat, every argument was offered every cohort: the CBCT baseline picker
listed the intraoral meshes, and picking one sends a folder of `.vtk` where a
volume is expected.

The server now publishes a subfolder on the argument and a list per subfolder
beside the flat one. What this pins is the client half: the scoped argument
reads its own list, an unscoped one reads the flat list exactly as before, and
a scope the server did not send falls back rather than emptying the picker.
