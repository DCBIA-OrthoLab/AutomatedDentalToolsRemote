"""Sections that open folded, and the two moments the fold has to be applied.

`_COLLAPSED_SECTIONS` is a one-line intention -- "Advanced" opens shut -- and
it has now failed twice for the same underlying reason: a ctkCollapsibleButton
folds by HIDING the children it has at that instant, so when the fold happens
matters more than the flag does.

The first failure was a row added after the fold, and the fix was to fold at
the end of the build. The second is subtler: `_buildForm` assembles the whole
panel into a DETACHED QWidget and parents it into the module afterwards, so
"the end of the build" is still a tree Qt has never realised, and the hide does
not survive the show that follows. The box reads as folded with its rows drawn
underneath it -- which is exactly what a "crushed" Advanced section looks like.

Neither failure was pinned by a test, which is why the second one shipped.
