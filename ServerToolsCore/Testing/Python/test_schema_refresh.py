"""A panel built from yesterday's schema is a panel that lies about the tool.

The schema is read once, at `setup()`. Nothing re-read it afterwards: `enter()`
refreshes the hosted FILES -- a model dropped into DATA/ -- but not the shape
of the form. So a field the server started publishing while Slicer was open is
simply absent, and a field it stopped publishing is still there and still
clickable. That is indistinguishable, from the panel, from a server that never
changed; it cost an afternoon of "the checkbox is not there" against a server
that had been publishing it for twenty minutes.

Rebuilding on EVERY enter() would be the wrong cure: a rebuild throws the form
away, and a path somebody typed and has not run yet must survive a trip to
another module. So the rule these tests pin is: re-read always, rebuild only on
a difference.
