      in it, and the Shift slider's range is computed from that volume, so a
      value set earlier is clamped against the wrong scan;
    * the SHIFT after the preset -- applying a preset resets the offset, so a
      shift set first is thrown away without a word;
    * VISIBILITY last -- reaching the module instantiates its widget, which
      reacts to the volume being selected and settles the rendering's state.

    Best effort, and loudly so. If a Slicer release renames one of these
    controls the rendering is still there, with the default curve, and the log
    says which name went missing rather than leaving a scene nobody can explain.
