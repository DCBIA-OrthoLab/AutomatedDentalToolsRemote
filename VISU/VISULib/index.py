"""What a folder of results holds, grouped so a reader can step through it.

The panel's job is to put a scan on screen with the landmarks, masks and
surfaces that belong to it. Nothing in this extension could answer which file
belongs to which, so this module does: it walks the folders it is given,
groups their files by patient, and says which anchor each overlay may be drawn
against.

**Why the grouping cannot be `os.listdir` and a sort.** Measured against the
tools as they are written today, four naming conventions coexist:

* `ALI`, `Crown_Seg` and `FlexReg` APPEND to the input stem, so
  `P1_scan.nii.gz` becomes `P1_scan_lm_Pred.mrk.json`;
* `ASO` CBCT TRUNCATES it -- the same input becomes `P1_Or.nii.gz` and
  `P1_lm_Or.mrk.json`, sharing no stem at all with ALI's output;
* `ASO` IOS writes its surface, its landmarks and its transform under THREE
  different stems, sharing only a patient-and-jaw key;
* `Crown_Seg` files half a batch under an extra `crownseg_input_<suffix>/`
  level and the other half beside it, and `AMASSS` invents a
  `<stem>_<id>_SegOut/` folder per scan.

Truncating at a known tool suffix, on token boundaries, is what reconciles the
first two -- and it is what `ASO` itself already does to read `ALI`'s output
back. `_normalise_directory` handles the last one.

**This is a third copy of an algorithm, deliberately.** The reference lives in
`SADT-VISOR` at `tools/AREG/common/src/sadt_areg_common/pairing.py`, and `ASO`
carries a second, older copy whose suffix table is missing `_Seg` -- so the two
already disagree on `arch_Seg.vtk`. A client cannot import either: they are
inside tool virtualenvs in another repository. The copy ends the day a run
publishes a manifest naming its own outputs, which is the only source that can
be right by construction rather than by guessing at names.
